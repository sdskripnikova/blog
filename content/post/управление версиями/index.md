## Congratulation
Looking through the list of proposed new versions, you will very quickly find that non-final versions of dependencies begin to appear there, which most likely you do not need. To describe which versions you would like to skip when updating, there is a special file where you can describe exceptions in the form of specific versions or regex expressions for specific dependencies or their groups. It should be noted that such projects as the Spring IO platform and Spring Boot in their parent projects already provide up-to-date and compatibility-tested versions of a very large number of libraries, which allows you to use them in your projects without specifying a specific version.
